# A Case of the Monday's (CSC Hacks)

## Project Description
We are working on creating a roguelike-esq game in python utilizing the pygame library. Our game will take place in an office/workplace setting as you fight off droves of zombie co-workers and bosses. Currently just a one room shooter in which you gain points for each zombie you kill, we aim to implement a shop system, randomly generated rooms, bosses, and more in the future.
